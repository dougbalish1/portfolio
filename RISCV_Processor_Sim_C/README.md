# A rudimentary RISC-V processor core emulated in C
## Both projects provided large codebase to be extended with more functionality
### Project 2 (not included separately): core.c reworked to emulate functionality of a pipelined processor and its stages
### Project 3: Hand-translated c functions to RISC-V assembly for minimal rework of emulator, reworked emulator to add sll, bne, and sd instructons and add 'memory'
This was a collaborative project, the results of which are summarized in the PDF file. Demonstrates understanding of low level hardware concepts, ASM, and advanced C.
