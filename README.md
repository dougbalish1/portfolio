# Portfolio
A small collection of my work/things I've worked on through school to demonstrate the type of work/languages I am familiar with. Please check out the rest of my repos for mostly non school work. 

Please also note that not all of the work is 100% my own, some assignments used templates or provided a code base to add features to, which I included as they show my ability to work in large, complex existing code as well as maintain style.
